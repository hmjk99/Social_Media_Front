# Stackbook
## intro
    Stackbook is a social media platform for developers to share, 
    network and collaborate in a user-friendly environment.
    Users can sign up for an account on the main screen to 
    gain access to the posts feed.
    Users can post images, text, create tags as well as 
    give/receive likes on their posts.
    Stackbook was created using a full MERN stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node).
    
## features
    Stackbook has several custom-built features, 
    among them are: 
    
    user authorization and authentication 
    
    generative image carousels on user posts 
    
    likes functionality 
    
    the ability to add mulitple images and tags on posts.
    
## challenges
    Stackbook was developed in seven days by a team of two engineers, 
    Jeffrey Bohac and Moonjoo Kim. 
    Lead Engineer, Moonjoo Kim created a functional 
    user-authorization system with token authentication in only 3 days 
    in addition to designing the prototype for Stackbook and overseeing 
    product consistency. Jeffrey Bohac worked as the UI engineer and developed 
    various systems for the post feed. User auth was a large task and required 
    a lot of time and focus on the part of the lead engineer, while the UI developer 
    was struggling to wrap his head around using state as this is the first project 
    either engineer had created with React.
    
## issues
    The add post and edit post forms both need some work in terms of adding 
    multiple images and tags. It is currently a functional feature but bugged 
    leading to posts occasionally having missing/broken image links and tags.
